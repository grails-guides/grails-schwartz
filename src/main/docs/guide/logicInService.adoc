Although the previous example is valid, usually you don't want to put your business logic in a Job. It is always better
to put it in a Service because that is where it belongs and it is also easier to maintain and test. Let's see a simple
example:

Create the following service:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/EmailService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/EmailService.groovy[]
----

And then the job:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/DailyEmailJobService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/DailyEmailJobService.groovy[tag=dailyEmailJobService]
----
<1> Inject the service
<2> Call it
<3> Trigger the job once a day at 04:30 AM
