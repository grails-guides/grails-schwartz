During this guide, we are going to use several log statements to show Job execution. 

Add at the end of `logback.groovy` the next statement:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/conf/logback.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/logback.groovy[indent=0, tag=logdemo]
----

The above line configures a logger for package `demo` with log level INFO which uses the STDOUT appender and with adaptivity set to false.
