Imagine the following scenario. You want to send every user an email 2 hours after they registered into your app. You want to ask him about his experiences during this first interaction with your service.

For this guide, we are going to schedule a Job to trigger after one minute. 

Modify `BootStrap.groovy` to call twice a new service named `RegisterService`.

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/init/demo/BootStrap.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/init/demo/BootStrap.groovy[]
----

Create `RegisterService.groovy`


[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/RegisterService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/RegisterService.groovy[]
----

<1> This method returns a date one minute into the future
<2> We can find the necessary `Jobkey` with the JobService's simpleName
<3> We can pass data into a Job execution.
<4> Schedule the trigger


Create `FollowupEmailJobService.groovy`


[source, groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/FollowupEmailJobService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/FollowupEmailJobService.groovy[]
----

<1> Extract the job data 

If you execute the above code you will see the Job being executed one minute after we schedule it and with the supplied email address.
